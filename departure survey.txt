It was, by far, the most exciting and interesting experience in my life. Learning a new culture and interacting with people that embrace this culture was exceptional.



Did your AT opportunity meet your expectations and did you meet the goals and
objectives proposed in your AT Request form? Please explain and include the most
important things you learned during your AT:

The AT I participated mostly met my expectations. At the beginning I thought we were going to develop our own cubesat, or at least, be in touch with the development of a real one. As soon as we started working, I realized the research topics were related to cubesat technologies, not to a cubesat itself. Which I found not to be a problem. There was about 27 research topics of which we should choose 5 plus the "main mission". I chose 6: Cubesat Swarm, TrapSat, Ion Drive Nuzzle, 3U Cubesat Frame, Jumpstarting Brazilian Aerospace Industry and SatNOGS. Unfortunately, I quit the 3U Cubesat Frame since I realized that we were not going to build a real frame. Besides it, I learnt a lot from those works. The main point were the fact my team work and managing skills were greatly improved and the fact I lived the complexity of Integration Engineering. In the end I can assure I met the goals and objectives proposed by the AT.




What aspects of your AT were the most difficult for you, and how did you handle these challenges?

Dealing with things out of my comfort zone, such as Electromagnetism, was a challenging point. But in the end I found myself enjoying developing research on that topic. Besides, the location of the university was also a difficult point. I bypassed that just by managing my schedule and being patient.
